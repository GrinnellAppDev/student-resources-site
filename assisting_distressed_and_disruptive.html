      <header class="studenttype">Disruptive Student</header>
      <p>A student who is disruptive is interfering with the College's learning enviornment due to behavior that is disruptive or dangerous. Disruptive students frequently experience on-going or extreme levels of stress without the appropriate coping skills; this indicates potential escalation if not resolved.</p>

      <p>Potential disruptive student behaviors:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Remember: It is not your role to provide the professional help needed for a disruptive student. You only need to make the necessary call and request assistance.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to directly ask the student if they have thoughts of harming themselves or others. If yes, do not leave the student. If necessary, find someone to stay with the student while you call the appropriate resources.</li>
      </ul>
      </br></br>
